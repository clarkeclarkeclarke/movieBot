The bot.py file is list of methods I used when creating @friendlyfilmbot.

They are pretty simple and straight forward, I'm still working on improving the methods.

@friendlyfilmbot is now on twitter with limited functionality. There's lots of room for improvment, I'm still perfecting phase 1,
will move onto phase 2 soon.

Phase 1 is basic functionality. Phase 2 is a secret. >:-)
